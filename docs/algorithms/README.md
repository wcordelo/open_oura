# Algorithms (ecore port)

Oura computes its daily metrics **on the phone**, in the native `ecore` engine
(`libappecore.so`) — not in the cloud (the cloud is storage/sync). The one
exception is the **sleep hypnogram**: ecore *consumes* a pre-computed 30-second
stage array and only produces the staging *features*; the stager itself is the
on-device **SleepNet** PyTorch model (encrypted `*.pt.enc` in `oura_models.apk`)
and/or the ring firmware. Everything *downstream of staging* is deterministic and
portable.

This directory documents each metric we port into `oura-analysis`. Source
addresses refer to functions in the decompiled `libappecore.so` (see
`native-decoder.md` for the Ghidra method). Per-metric detail files are added as
each is ported; this index is the status table.

## Device vs cloud (corrected)

Earlier we read the `score` + `*_algorithm_version` JSON fields as cloud-computed.
They are actually computed **on-device** by ecore (versions `v1/v2/nssa/sleepnet`
identify *local* algorithms), written to the local Realm `DbSleep`/`DbDaily*`, then
**uploaded**; the cloud serves the same locally-produced doc back on sync. There is
**no network code in ecore** — all tuning is embedded `get_default_*` tables or
host-supplied via `set_*` setters.

**Reproducible offline by porting ecore:** sleep/readiness/activity scores, sleep
debt, durations/efficiency, nightly temperature + baseline, HRV/RMSSD, resting-HR
percentiles, breathing rate, simple SpO2, activity targets/calories/MET, cycle.

**Not from ecore alone:** the **hypnogram** (needs the SleepNet model or the ring's
staging), **SpO2 OVI** (NaN stub) and **BDI/apnea** scoring (delegated), and the
exact **algorithm-version + baseline-state history** required to match Oura
bit-for-bit.

## Persisted state an independent client must carry across days

ecore is stateless-per-call; the host re-injects state each night via typed
objects: recovery state (+prev), temperature baseline, previous sleep periods,
cycle-tracking state, and the SpO2 main storage (the only native binary serializer,
versioned TLV). Mirror these in `oura-store` so baselines accumulate.

## Score combiners: structure recovered, exact tables blocked → use calibration

The three 0–100 scores were chased to the combiner level: the sleep mapper
(`FUN_001f5e64`) is a per-contributor piecewise interp (X = age-derived limits
from `init_limits_v2`, shared Y-curve `DAT_0017bcb7`, weights `DAT_0017bcbf`
summing to 100, contributor 8 = `sleep_timing_score`, final `round(Σ wᵢ·cᵢ/100)`);
the activity combiner (`get_activity_score_from_raw_100`) and the legacy/modern
readiness paths are likewise resolved structurally. **But the constant tables they
read (`DAT_0017bcb7/bcbf`, readiness weights `0x17bff8/bfdc`, activity X-tables)
do not read back cleanly from this APK's `libappecore.so` build** — direct ELF
extraction yields non-monotonic/garbage values and several live in `.data`
populated at runtime. So an exact bit-match of Oura's scores isn't feasible from
this artifact alone.

**Practical path (validated): calibration.** We have all the raw inputs (sleep
durations, HRV, resting HR, temperature deviation, MET) and the user's trends
export pairs those with Oura's contributor sub-scores and final scores. A linear
fit reproduces the **Sleep Score at R²=0.999** (and Readiness/Activity close) — see
`data-recovery-map.md`. So `oura-analysis::score` will fit weights from the trends
CSV rather than porting the unreadable `.rodata`; the decompiled structure
(contributor set, the piecewise shape, the weighted-sum-/100 combination) guides
the model. Bit-exact reproduction would need a cleaner build's `.rodata` or
device-side calibration data.
