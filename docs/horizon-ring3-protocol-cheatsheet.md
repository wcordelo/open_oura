# Oura Ring 3 Horizon BLE Protocol Cheatsheet

Baseline reference: ringverse `oura/BLE.md` for Oura Ring 4 protocol notes.
Live target: Oura Ring 3 Horizon, BLE MAC `a0:38:f8:2a:6c:a5`, firmware
`3.4.3`, API `2.0.0`, BT stack `5.0.12`.

Captured on 2026-06-21 in Lisbon from macOS/CoreBluetooth. Raw JSONL captures
are under ignored `captures/`.

## Connection

- Advertised service: `98ed0001-a541-11e4-b6a0-0002a5d5c51b`
- Notify/read characteristic: `98ed0003-a541-11e4-b6a0-0002a5d5c51b`
- Write characteristic: `98ed0002-a541-11e4-b6a0-0002a5d5c51b`
- MTU: `203`
- After factory reset, macOS pairing/link encryption is required before notify
  subscription or writes. Before the pairing prompt is approved, CoreBluetooth
  returns `Encryption is insufficient`.
- macOS peripheral UUID remained stable during this capture, but the advertised
  name changed from `Oura 2H3A2347004369`/`Oura 2H3A23470043` to
  `Oura Ring Gen3` after app auth key setup.

Packet format matches ringverse:

- Request/response: `tag length payload...`
- Multi-byte integers observed little-endian.
- Extended operations use outer tag `0x2f`, with the first payload byte as the
  extended operation tag.

## App Auth

Auth is session-scoped. Run it after connecting when a command returns
`2f022f01`.

1. Set a key on a factory-reset ring:
   - Request: `24 10 <16-byte key>`
   - Success response: `250100`
2. Request nonce:
   - Request: `2f012b`
   - Response: `2f102c <15-byte nonce>`
3. Authenticate:
   - Encrypt the 15-byte nonce using `AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding` with the 16-byte
     auth key.
   - Request: `2f112d <16-byte encrypted nonce>`
   - Success response: `2f022e00`
   - Wrong-key response: `2f022e01`

Feature setters tested after auth:

| Name | Request | Response | Follow-up status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Set daytime HR mode off | `2f03220200` | `2f03230200` | Feature `0x02` then reported mode `0` / off. |
| Set daytime HR mode automatic | `2f03220201` | `2f03230200` | Feature `0x02` restored to mode `1` / automatic. |
| Set daytime HR subscription latest | `2f03260202` | `2f03270200` | ACK success, but feature `0x02` still reported subscription `0` / off. |
| Set daytime HR subscription off | `2f03260200` | `2f03270200` | ACK success, feature `0x02` remained subscription `0` / off. |
| Set daytime HR params payload `00` | `2f03290200` | `2f032a0200` | ACK success. |
| Set bundling off | `2f020300` | `2f020400` | Repeated off returned `0`; left in off state. |
| Set bundling on | `2f020301` | `2f020401` | ACK returned `1`; followed by off restore. |

On-finger realtime/listener follow-up:

- With the ring worn, `060401000000` still only emitted `070100`; no push
  movement, HR, or raw sample packets were observed over 90s.
- On-finger feature polling did change daytime HR status once:
  `2f06210201110200` decoded as feature `2`, mode automatic, status `17`,
  state measuring, subscription off.
- The corresponding latest daytime HR packet changed to
  `2f1025020011020000000003000000990c7f`. Subsequent polls returned idle
  status with stable latest payloads, so this is usable as a quasi-live polling
  path but not a raw stream.
- After a polling disconnect, realtime off was explicitly restored on a fresh
  connection: `060400000000` -> `070100`.

## Horizon Deltas And Issues

- BLE link encryption is mandatory on factory-reset Horizon before any protocol
  command can be written. This is stricter than the earlier Ring 5 observation,
  where firmware was readable without app authentication.
- App-level auth is not required for firmware, product info, capabilities,
  auth nonce, sync time, notifications, BLE mode, realtime-off, user-info empty
  setters, ring mode, or sleep-analysis check after BLE pairing.
- App-level auth is required for battery, basic feature status, history events,
  RData, manufacturing sync, feature-latest values, and feature parameter reads
  once an auth key has been installed. Unauthenticated attempts return
  `2f022f01`.
- App auth must be repeated per BLE connection.
- After `SetAuthKey`, the advertised name changed to generic `Oura Ring Gen3`.
- Capabilities response reports two pages; both page 0 and page 1 were captured.
- Product info uses both legacy and newer offsets. The primary hardware ID is
  `BLB_03`; serial is `2H3A2347004369`.
- `0x01` and `0x02` still produce no response, matching ringverse.
- The local runner decodes upstream enum names for auth results, feature
  mode/state/subscription, feature set/latest results, DFU status, firmware
  update status, and event tags. This keeps future JSONL captures readable even
  for packet families that were not run live.
- Realtime tag `0x06` appears to be an enable/disable control, not a complete
  public stream selector. Payload `01000000` ACKs success but did not emit
  movement, HR, or other sensor samples during a 60s listener run. Other simple
  mode guesses returned status `2`.

## Ring 5 Comparison

Current Oura Ring 5 public hardware docs list optical sensing, temperature, and
accelerometer movement tracking. They do not expose a public BLE raw motion
stream or claim a raw gyroscope interface. Ring 5 improves the hardware
architecture versus older rings with smaller packaging, redesigned optical
sensors, two tri-LED emitters, two photodetectors, a digital temperature sensor,
accelerometer movement tracking, and 12 optical signal pathways. From the Ring
3 Horizon protocol side, the relevant commonality is that movement appears to be
accelerometer-based, while raw motion streaming remains unproven.

## Captured Events

Authenticated event fetch returned event tags `0x41` and `0x43` before the
`0x11` summary packet.

| Tag | Meaning | Horizon payload notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x41` | Ring start | Included firmware/API bytes and boot metadata. |
| `0x43` | Debug event | ASCII debug strings were observed, including `git;ca22327`, `SNH;4369`, and `SNL;2H3A234700`. |

## Coverage Matrix

| Packet family | Horizon status |
| --- | --- |
| `0x01`, `0x02` unknown | Tested after auth; no response. |
| `0x03` RData | State, page 0, start-none-zero, and stop tested after auth. Clear shape is in the runner but was not run. |
| `0x06` realtime measurements | Off and six enable/guess payloads tested. `01000000` ACKed success but did not stream samples; other guesses returned status `2`. |
| `0x08` firmware | Tested, success. |
| `0x0a` self test | Written after auth; no notification observed in 1.5s. |
| `0x0c` battery | Tested unauthenticated failure and authenticated success. |
| `0x0e` firmware update | Packet shape added as danger; not run. |
| `0x10` events | Tested unauthenticated failure and authenticated success. |
| `0x12` sync time | Tested, success-shaped response. |
| `0x16` BLE mode | Tested normal and fast-HR, restored normal. Deep sleep is gated as danger and was not run. |
| `0x18` product info | All six Android/ringverse product slots tested. |
| `0x1a` factory reset | Packet shape added as danger; not run. |
| `0x1c` notification flags | Tested `0x00` and restored `0x3f`, success. |
| `0x20` user info | Empty gender/height/weight/unit and date-of-birth-zero setters tested, success. |
| `0x24` auth key | Tested on factory-reset ring, success. |
| `0x26` flight mode | Packet shape added as danger; not run. |
| `0x28` sleep analysis check | Tested force `0` and force `1`, success. |
| `0x2b` DFU | Reset, zeroed start, zeroed block, and zeroed activate packet shapes added as danger; not run. Real block/activate need image-specific payloads. |
| `0x2f` extended capabilities/status/auth | Capabilities and nonce work before app auth; feature status was tested both unauthenticated failure and authenticated success; auth, latest values, one feature-param read, bundling setter, daytime HR mode/subscription setters, and daytime HR param setter tested. |
| `0x31` ring mode | Tested normal and fast-HR, restored normal. Deep sleep is gated as danger and was not run. |
| `0x37` set manufacturing info | Packet shapes added as danger; not run. |
| `0x39` sync manufacturing info | Tested after auth, success. |

## Untested Or Intentionally Skipped

Skipped because they are destructive, disruptive, or need narrower follow-up
work:

- Factory reset `1a00`
- Firmware update / DFU start / DFU reset / block transfer
- Flight mode `26026027`
- Memory/data clear
- Deep-sleep BLE mode
- Realtime raw sample decoding remains unresolved: no movement/HR/sample packets
  were observed from tested `0x06` modes.
- RData page transfer protocol beyond state/page0/start-none-zero/stop status
  checks
- Set manufacturing info
- Deep-sleep ring mode

## Future Test Commands

Install deps:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

List commands:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/oura_protocol.py --list
```

Run safe matrix:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/oura_protocol.py safe-matrix \
  --name-contains "Oura Ring Gen3" \
  --capture captures/horizon-ring3-safe-matrix.jsonl
```

Run auth-required safe reads:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/oura_protocol.py auth-safe-matrix \
  --auth-key-file captures/horizon-ring3-auth-key.hex \
  --name-contains "Oura Ring Gen3" \
  --capture captures/horizon-ring3-safe-extra.jsonl
```

This auth matrix includes battery and basic feature-status reads because those
return `2f022f01` on a fresh connection before `Authenticate`.

Authenticate then fetch events:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/oura_protocol.py auth events \
  --auth-key-file captures/horizon-ring3-auth-key.hex \
  --name-contains "Oura Ring Gen3" \
  --capture captures/horizon-ring3-events.jsonl
```

Set a new auth key only when the ring is intentionally factory-reset:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/oura_protocol.py auth battery \
  --generate-auth-key \
  --set-auth-key \
  --capture captures/horizon-ring3-auth.jsonl
```

State-changing and destructive packet shapes are hidden from default runs. Use
`--include-state` for non-destructive state changes and `--include-danger` only
when intentionally testing destructive or disruptive behavior.

Listen for realtime notifications:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/oura_realtime_listener.py --mode mode1 --seconds 60 \
  --auth-key-file captures/horizon-ring3-auth-key.hex \
  --name-contains "Oura Ring Gen3" \
  --capture captures/horizon-ring3-realtime-mode1-long.jsonl
```

Poll feature status/latest values while the listener is active:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/oura_realtime_listener.py --mode mode1 --seconds 40 \
  --poll-latest --poll-interval 5 \
  --auth-key-file captures/horizon-ring3-auth-key.hex \
  --name-contains "Oura Ring Gen3" \
  --capture captures/horizon-ring3-realtime-mode1-onfinger-poll.jsonl
```

Use `--payload-hex <4 bytes>` to test additional `0x06` payloads. The listener
authenticates first and restores realtime off (`060400000000`) on exit by
default.
