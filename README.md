# open_oura

Reverse-engineering the Oura ring BLE protocol, plus an independent, **cloud-free**
client that reads your data straight from the ring.

Tested live against a Ring 3 Horizon and a Ring 5 (pairing, auth, and event sync
confirmed on both). Designed for Ring 3/4/5, which share the same GATT layout,
packet framing, and authentication flow.

## What you can recover

Straight from the ring, with no Oura account: device info, battery, live heart rate
(IBI to BPM), latest HR / SpO2, and the full history-event stream. That stream
carries raw PPG/IBI/temperature/motion/SpO2 samples plus the ring's **on-device**
sleep stages, activity MET levels, and HRV.

What you **cannot** get from the ring: the 0-100 Readiness / Sleep / Activity /
Stress scores and workout auto-classification. Those are computed in Oura's cloud,
not on the ring. See [`docs/data-recovery-map.md`](docs/data-recovery-map.md).

## Repository map

- **`crates/`**: the Rust client, split by concern (`oura-protocol` decode,
  `oura-link` fetch, `oura-analysis` metrics, `oura-store` SQLite, `oura-cli`).
  Start here: [`crates/README.md`](crates/README.md) and
  [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).
- **`tools/`**: Python research bench for protocol exploration. `oura_protocol.py`
  (full command matrix, auth, danger-gated ops, JSONL capture) and
  `oura_realtime_listener.py`.
- **`docs/`**: protocol and reverse-engineering reference (index below).
- **`reverse/`, `captures/`**: local-only, gitignored. The decompiled app and raw
  captures (which may contain serials, MACs, and auth keys).

## Quick start (Rust client)

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/oura scan
./target/release/oura --key-file key.hex info
```

See [`crates/README.md`](crates/README.md) for all commands (`scan`, `pair`,
`info`, `sync`, `latest`, `live-hr`, `accel`, `poc`, `log`, `viz`, `game`, `features`, `rdata`,
`events`, `redecode`, `sleep-analyze`, `sessions`) and the auth-key details. `oura poc` is the
Berendo Labs proof-of-concept (motion visualizer + raw JSONL logger); see
[`docs/poc.md`](docs/poc.md). `oura viz` opens a real-time 3D motion visualizer in the browser; `oura game` is a tilt-controlled
asteroid game driven by the ring.

## Research bench (Python)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python tools/oura_protocol.py --list
```

State-changing and destructive commands are hidden behind `--include-state` and
`--include-danger`. On macOS, grant Bluetooth permission to the terminal.

## Documentation

- [`docs/horizon-ring3-protocol-cheatsheet.md`](docs/horizon-ring3-protocol-cheatsheet.md):
  the protocol command reference (requests, responses, auth, features), Ring 3.
- [`docs/android-app-reversing.md`](docs/android-app-reversing.md): app internals,
  BLE constants, the auth operations, key generation, and nonce encryption.
- [`docs/data-recovery-map.md`](docs/data-recovery-map.md): what the ring emits vs
  what only the cloud computes.
- [`docs/sync-orchestration.md`](docs/sync-orchestration.md): when and how the app
  pulls each data channel, and the minimal client sync recipe.
- [`docs/ring-5-observations.md`](docs/ring-5-observations.md): Ring 5 BLE surface
  and first-contact findings.
- [`docs/firmware-update.md`](docs/firmware-update.md): the DFU/OTA opcodes and why
  a custom image cannot be flashed (encrypted, device-resident key).
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md): the fetch/interpret/apply crate
  layering and where to add things.
- [`docs/algorithms/README.md`](docs/algorithms/README.md): the on-device ecore
  metric algorithms (scores, sleep, baselines) and their porting status.
- [`docs/native-decoder.md`](docs/native-decoder.md): porting event-body decoders
  from the native `libringeventparser.so` (how the byte layouts were recovered with
  Ghidra).

## Safety and secrets

- Prefer passive, read-only requests. reset / DFU / factory-reset / flight-mode are
  gated behind explicit flags; do not send them during normal use.
- App-gated operations need the ring's 16-byte auth key (re-sent each connection).
  Captures and keys are gitignored. Never commit a key.
