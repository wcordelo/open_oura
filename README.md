# open_oura

Reverse-engineering the Oura ring BLE protocol, and an independent, **cloud-free**
client that reads your data straight from the ring.

Tested live against a Ring 3 Horizon **and a Ring 5** (pairing, auth, and event
sync confirmed on both); designed for Ring 3/4/5, which share the same GATT layout,
packet framing, and authentication flow.

## What you can recover

Straight from the ring, with no Oura account: device info, battery, live heart rate
(IBI → BPM), latest HR / SpO2, and the full history-event stream — raw
PPG/IBI/temperature/motion/SpO2 samples plus the ring's **on-device** sleep stages,
activity MET levels, and HRV.

What you **cannot** get from the ring: the 0–100 Readiness / Sleep / Activity /
Stress scores and workout auto-classification. Those are computed in Oura's cloud,
not on the ring — see [`docs/data-recovery-map.md`](docs/data-recovery-map.md).

## Repository map

- **`crates/`** — the Rust client: a reusable `oura-core` library and the `oura`
  CLI. Start here → [`crates/README.md`](crates/README.md).
- **`tools/`** — Python research bench used for protocol exploration:
  `oura_protocol.py` (full command matrix, auth, danger-gated ops, JSONL capture)
  and `oura_realtime_listener.py`.
- **`docs/`** — protocol and reverse-engineering reference (index below).
- **`reverse/`, `captures/`** — local-only, gitignored: the decompiled app and raw
  captures (which may contain serials, MACs, and auth keys).

## Quick start (Rust client)

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/oura scan
./target/release/oura --key-file key.hex info
```

See [`crates/README.md`](crates/README.md) for all commands (`scan`, `info`,
`sync`, `latest`, `live-hr`, `events`) and the auth-key details.

## Research bench (Python)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python tools/oura_protocol.py --list
```

State-changing and destructive commands are hidden behind `--include-state` /
`--include-danger`. On macOS, grant Bluetooth permission to the terminal.

## Documentation

- [`docs/horizon-ring3-protocol-cheatsheet.md`](docs/horizon-ring3-protocol-cheatsheet.md)
  — the protocol command reference (requests, responses, auth, features), Ring 3.
- [`docs/android-app-reversing.md`](docs/android-app-reversing.md) — app internals:
  BLE constants, the auth operations, key generation, and nonce encryption.
- [`docs/data-recovery-map.md`](docs/data-recovery-map.md) — what the ring emits vs
  what only the cloud computes.
- [`docs/sync-orchestration.md`](docs/sync-orchestration.md) — when and how the app
  pulls each data channel; the minimal client sync recipe.
- [`docs/ring-5-observations.md`](docs/ring-5-observations.md) — Ring 5 BLE surface
  and first-contact findings.
- [`docs/firmware-update.md`](docs/firmware-update.md) — the DFU/OTA opcodes and
  why a custom image can't be flashed (encrypted, device-resident key).
- [`docs/native-decoder.md`](docs/native-decoder.md) — porting event-body decoders
  from the native `libringeventparser.so` (how the exact byte layouts were
  recovered with Ghidra).

## Safety and secrets

- Prefer passive, read-only requests. reset / DFU / factory-reset / flight-mode are
  gated behind explicit flags; do not send them during normal use.
- App-gated operations need the ring's 16-byte auth key (re-sent each connection).
  Captures and keys are gitignored — never commit a key.
